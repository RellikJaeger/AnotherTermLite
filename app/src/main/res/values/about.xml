<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Why another one? Just to have:</p>
<ulc>
    <lic>Local pty, USB UART etc. support in the same application;</lic>
    <lic>Adequate screen input methods as long as a terminal requires specific keyboard
    functions.</lic>
</ulc>
<h1>Features</h1>
<ulc>
<lic>Minimum supported Android version is 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich.</lic>
<lic>Supported USB UART devices: Generic USB CDC, CP210X, FTDI, PL2303, CH34x, CP2130 SPI-USB.</lic>
<lic>Local Linux pty is supported. Feel free to follow directions from
<a href="http://kevinboone.net/android_nonroot.html">
<i>Using standard Linux utilities in a stock, non-rooted Android device</i> by Kevin Boone</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/green-green-avk/build-proot-android/tree/master/packages">
especially compiled PRoot</a>. ;)</lic>
<lic>Shell tool to interact with the Android environment is also present.
<ulc>
<lic>Content exchange between other applications and own files / pipes has been implemented
(like Termux).</lic>
<lic>It also works in chrooted environments (PRoot at least).</lic>
<lic>USB serial port dongle access from the command line is also implemented (unlike Termux) ;).</lic>
</ulc>
</lic>
<lic>Telnet (no encryption).</lic>
<lic>No SSH in the Lite version.</lic>

<h1>Notes</h1>
<p>Please, be aware, that key mapping of hardware input devices is provided by device vendors
and it could make some troubles.
For example: ASUS ZenFone 4 Max has the hardware keyboard `Home\' (KEYCODE_MOVE_HOME) key
mapped as the Android middle (KEYCODE_HOME) button that makes it effectively invisible for
applications.
Most vendors also maps mouse right and middle buttons in some unexpected ways.
Fortunately, mouse buttons mapping can usually be worked around.
Most usual right mouse button mapping as the Android `Back\' (KEYCODE_BACK) button
is supported by this application.
The only way to change the vendor\'s mapping is to root your device and change appropriate files
manually.</p>
<p>Due to an USB bug in Android itself, it\'s highly recommended not to use the USB UART
with devices running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop.
